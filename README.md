This repo has the code/process for exploring NBER working paper data

- The R notebook `metaplots-metadata.Rmd` makes all the .png files and yields markdown code for tables -- can also see this on RPubs [here](https://rpubs.com/apalbright/metaplots-metadata)
- The 6/28/21 version downloaded NBER metadata is in the `nber-data` subdirectory
- Generated graphs are in the `graphs` subdirectory
