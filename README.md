This repo has the code/process for exploring NBER working paper data

- The R notebook `metaplots-metadata.Rmd` makes all the .png files and yields markdown code for tables -- can also see this on RPubs [here](https://rpubs.com/apalbright/metaplots-metadata)
- Data is called directly from NBER URLs, which update with new papers over time (as such, the notebook will change output as the raw data updates)
- Generated graphs are in the `graphs` subdirectory
